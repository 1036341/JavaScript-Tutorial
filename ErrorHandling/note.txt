Error Handling
-------------------
No matter how good you are at programming, your scripts might consist of errors. 
They may occur because of our mistakes, unexpected user input, 
an erroneous server response, or any other reason.

Usually, a script stops immediately in case of an error, printing it to console. 
Now, there’s a syntax construct try..catch that allows catching errors and, instead of dying, 
do something more reasonable.

The Try..Catch Syntax
The try..catch construct has two main blocks:

Try
Catch

First, the code in try {…} is executed.

If there are no errors, then catch(err) is ignored. The execution reaches the end of try and goes on, 
skipping catch.

If an error occurs, then try execution is stopped, and the control flows to the beginning of catch(err).
