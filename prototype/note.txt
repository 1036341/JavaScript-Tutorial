Advanced JavaScript Tutorial: Prototypes
----------------------------------------
In JavaScript, objects have a special hidden property known as Prototype which depicts either null or 
references another object. Now, that object is called a prototype. In this advanced JavaScript Tutorial, 
we will discuss two important features of prototype:

Prototypal Inheritance
Prototype methods, objects without __proto__
 

Prototypal Inheritance
---------------------
In programming, we often want to take something and extend it. Suppose, 
you have a user object with its properties and methods and you want to make admin and guest as 
slightly modified variants of it. Here, you want to reuse what is there in the user, not copy its methods, 
just build a new object on top of it.

Prototypal inheritance is a language feature that helps in that.

Prototype methods, objects without __proto__
--------------------------------------------------
In prototypal inheritance, we used __proto__ but this is an outdated method now. 
In this advanced JavaScript Tutorial, we will have a look at the modern methods to set up a prototype:
